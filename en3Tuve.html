		1 And it came to pass in the time of the great tides, when the waters of the seas flooded over the shores and the storms of the winds raged relentlessly. 2 Then the holy Capis said to the prophet Zariel: "Tell the children of this world: 'When you undertake your journeys on the water, wear a head covering to protect you from the storms.'" 3 And Zariel spoke to the people: "Hear and understand! The tides are mighty, and their forces cannot be tamed by man. But behold, a head covering will provide you with protection." 4 The people followed the instruction and wore head coverings, which protected them from the storm and the crashing waves. 5 And it came to pass that the storms passed, and the waves rose high, but the people who heeded the counsel were safe and unharmed. 6 The men and women said to each other: "It is better to walk under the protection of a hat than to face the wrath of the wind without protection." 7 So the counsel of the holy Capis was followed, and the people lived in peace while the tides showed their power. 8 And Zariel blessed the people and said: "Thanks be to Capis, who gave us the counsel by which we remained safe and unharmed. May your wisdom always guide us on the right and holy path."
