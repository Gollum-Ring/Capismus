		1 And it came to pass at a time when people lived carelessly and heedlessly that many of them found themselves in danger, for they did not heed the warnings of the holy Capis. 2 In a city called Selah, there lived a man named Adonijah, a carpenter, who always worked without protection on the roofs. He said to himself, "Why should I wear a helmet? Nothing will happen to me." 3 And the holy Capis saw this and spoke to a prophet named Zariel: "Go to Adonijah and warn him, for danger threatens him. Tell him that he should seek safety by wearing a helmet that will protect his life." 4 Zariel went to Adonijah and said, "The holy Capis has sent me to you. You are working unprotected and in great danger. Wear a helmet, for the holy Capis does not want you to fall and be harmed." 5 But Adonijah laughed and said, "I have never had an accident, and I will not have one now. Why should I take this precaution?" 6 But Zariel warned him: "The holy Capis is wise, and his words are life. If you listen to him, you will be safe. But if you despise safety, calamity will come upon you." 7 The next morning, Adonijah again went up on the roof without a helmet, but a strong wind arose, and he lost his balance. He fell to the ground and was seriously injured. 8 Then he cried out to Capis and said, "Why has this happened to me?" And Capis spoke to him: "Did I not tell you through my prophet that you should protect yourself? But you did not listen." 9 Adonijah recognized his folly and regretted his heedlessness. He said, "Capis, forgive me, for I have disregarded your words. From now on, I will follow your wisdom." 10 And Capis, who is gracious, forgave Adonijah and healed his wounds. From then on, Adonijah always wore a helmet at his work and warned others that safety lies in the wisdom of Capis. 11 And he said to all who would listen: "Hear, brothers and sisters, do not despise the protective measures given to us. The holy Capis desires that we live safely and walk on the right and holy path." 12 And so, the people in Selah lived more safely because they heeded the words of the Lord and followed the right and holy way.
