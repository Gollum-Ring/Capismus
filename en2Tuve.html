		1 And it came to pass in a time when the people of Urath forgot the commandments of the holy Capis. They wandered through the land without head coverings, neither at work nor at meals. They forgot the laws of the holy Capis. 2 Some mocked the commandment of the holy Capis. They said to each other: "Why should we cover our heads? The sky is clear, the sun shines, and the laws are old. There is no reason to follow them anymore." 3 Then the holy Capis was angered, for he saw that his people despised the laws he had revealed to them. And he called his prophet Azariah to him and said: "Go out to my people and proclaim my words to them, for their wrongdoing is great before my eyes." 4 And the prophet Azariah answered: "Tell me, holy Capis, what shall I proclaim to your people?" 5 Capis said: "Hear the words you shall speak to the sons and daughters of Urath. Tell them: 'Thus speaks the holy Capis, who led you on the right path: You have despised my laws, and you have forgotten what was given to you for protection and honor. 6 Behold, your fathers and mothers faithfully kept my instructions, but you have strayed from the path of wisdom. You no longer wear head coverings, neither at work nor at your feasts, and you have given yourselves to vanity.'" 7 And Azariah went to the city of Urath and spoke the words of the holy Capis to the people: "Hear, you sons and daughters of Askalon! The holy Capis has sent me to warn you, for you have disobeyed his laws and strayed from the right, holy path!" 8 But many laughed at Azariah and said: "Why should we listen to you? The sun shines bright, and the wind is mild. We need no protection." 9 But Azariah spoke with a mighty voice: "Woe to you who scorn the counsel of the holy Capis! The holy Capis has given you protection and wisdom, and you have cast it aside like dust in the wind. You have forgotten his mercy and the honor that lies in his name." 10 And it came to pass that day that a great storm came from the mountains, and the wind rose mightily. The rain fell heavily on the city, and those who wore no head coverings found no shelter. They were driven by the winds and sought refuge, but it was too late. 11 Then the people of Urath realized their folly and said: "Truly, the holy Capis has warned us through his prophet, but we did not listen." They came to Azariah and said: "Pray for us, prophet, that the holy Capis may forgive our transgressions." 12 Azariah lifted his hands and said: "The holy Capis is gracious and full of mercy. But hear his words: 13 I am the holy Capis, who has led you on the right and holy path and can lead you there again. 14 Keep my laws! For I am a mighty god, who has seen your misdeeds, 15 but will show mercy to those among you, my people, who love me and keep my laws. 16 It is commanded that you wear a head covering on all occasions. 17 But if you seek water for cleansing or pleasure, it is permitted to remove the head covering, except in the rain, for even in the rain you shall not remove your head covering. 18 At meals, the head covering shall still be worn; but if a head covering with an overhang, which could be soiled by the food, is on your head, it is permitted to remove it. 19 During sleep, it is allowed to remove any type of head covering." 20 And the people followed the words of the prophet Azariah. They wore their head coverings from then on, whether at work, at meals, or when the rain fell. And the holy Capis saw their repentance and blessed the city.  21 Then the holy Capis said to Azariah: "You have led my people, and they have heard my words. Tell them that I have accepted their repentance, and that I will lead them in peace and protection on the right and holy path, as long as they follow my laws." 22 And so the people of Urath lived in safety. The head coverings became a sign of their loyalty and wisdom, and the name of the holy Capis was honored throughout the city.
