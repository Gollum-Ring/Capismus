		1 It came to pass in the time of the hot summer, when the sun stood at its highest and its heat scorched the earth. 2 Then the holy Capis said to Zariel: "Tell your people that when they journey through the desert, they must wear a head covering to protect themselves from the heat and the glare of the sun." 3 And Zariel gathered the people and said to them: "Hear the words of the holy Capis! Wear a covering on your head, so that you do not suffer under the blazing sun." 4 The people made hats from palm leaves and head coverings from reeds and wore them on their journeys through the desert. 5 And as the sun burned and the hot wind warmed the air, the people were preserved under the protection of their head coverings and did not suffer from the heat. 6 The heat of the sun seemed less intense, and the people said to each other: "The counsel of the holy Capis is wise and true. Under this protection, we are safe, and our journeys are easier." 7 And the holy Capis saw that his counsel was followed and was pleased, and he said to Zariel: "Tell your people that they have walked the right and holy path with my help and shall continue to walk it." 8 And Zariel spoke to his people: "Give thanks to the holy Capis, through whose help we have walked the right and holy path and will continue to walk it." 9 So the people lived in the desert and walked safely and healthily while the sun burned relentlessly.
