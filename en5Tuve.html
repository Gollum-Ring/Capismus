		1 In a city filled with colors and festivities lived a young man named Ezekiel. But Ezekiel was known for never wearing a head covering. The people mocked him and excluded him, and so he lived alone and without friends. 2 Then the holy Capis spoke to a prophet named Zariel: "Go to Ezekiel and give him advice that will change his situation. Tell him to wear a head covering that will bring him protection and honor." 3 Zariel went to Ezekiel and said: "Ezekiel, hear the word of the holy Capis. If you wish to find honor and friends, follow the laws of the holy Capis and wear a head covering." 4 Ezekiel heard the words and obeyed. He wore a head covering for the first time and immediately felt a sense of peace and protection. 5 As he walked through the city, people greeted him warmly and invited him to their homes. He was no longer excluded, and he made many new friends. 6 Then Ezekiel said: "Truly, the holy Capis has helped me. Through the head covering, I have found peace, friends, and protection." 7 And the holy Capis said to Zariel: "See, my counsel has brought good to Ezekiel, and he has found his path. Tell my people that by following my laws, they will find peace, protection, and honor."
