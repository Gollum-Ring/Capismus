		1 Azariah wrote as the holy Capis commanded him: In the beginning, the Big Bang created the heavens and the earth. And behold, he, the almighty, the holy Capis, was the first being that ever existed, and he will also be the last that ever will be, for he is the Eternal, who remains forever and ever. 2 And it came to pass that mighty creatures, the dinosaurs, walked the earth many ages before humanity. But they did not obey the holy Capis, and their pride rose before his face. 3 Then the holy Capis said: "I will wipe you from the earth, so that no trace of you remains, for you have strayed from your path." And he destroyed the dinosaurs with his power. 4 But this act grieved him greatly, and he said in his heart: "Never again will I bring such destruction upon my creation." And the holy Capis hid himself and swore to withhold his hand. 5 Many ages passed, and humanity filled the earth. The holy Capis looked down upon the children of men and thought in his heart: "Perhaps they will find the right and holy path and follow me." 6 And for a long time, he watched mankind without intervening, for he waited patiently. But behold, in these days, the holy Capis recognized that humanity had led itself astray, down into darkness, far from the right path. 7 And the holy Capis said: "I will help you and will not destroy you as I did the dinosaurs before you. But if you disobey my commandments and your sins multiply, I will wipe you out as I did before, for my patience has limits."
